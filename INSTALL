Thanks for downloading duty.

To install it, make sure you have Python 3.3 or greater installed. Then run
this command from the command prompt:

	python setup.py install (in coding)

If you're upgrading from a previous version, you need to remove it first.

AS AN ALTERNATIVE, you can just copy duty to:
	/usr/bin
